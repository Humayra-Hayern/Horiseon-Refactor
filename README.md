# 01 Refactoring Horiseon Webpage
Horiseon requested me to refactor their web application code so it is fine-tuned and follows accessibility standards. I was working with HTML and CSS for this task. After the completion of this project I have learnt how; 
* to create a repository on GitHub, 
* to format a HTML & CSS file, 
* add comments to lines of code 
* to commit and push changes to GitHub



## User Story 
```
As a marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria 
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Horiseon Webpage 
The image below displays the web application's appearance to the user after being refactored and deployed:

This layout is for desktop Web Browser's only. This website is not optimized at the moment for smaller screen sizes.
